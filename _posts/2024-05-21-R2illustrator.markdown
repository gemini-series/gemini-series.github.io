## Registration

**[Register using this form](https://forms.gle/ivGQetcGvdmS7uxg6)!**.  The workshop is free to UPenn graduate students, postdocs, faculty, and staff, but registration is required and seating is limited.

The workshop will take place in the [Holman Reading Room](https://www.library.upenn.edu/holman) in the Biomedical library, and is free to UPenn graduate students, postdocs, faculty, and staff.

## Overview

The first half of the day will introduce you to Adobe Illustrator basics. The second half of the day will focus on linking analyses in R to Adobe Illustrator to create beautiful figures that are directly connected to the data.

## Workshop resources

* [Adobe Illustrator worksheet](https://gemini-series.netlify.app/code/Illustrator_worksheets.ai) - This is the worksheet used in the first half of the workshop to familiarize users with key features of Adobe Illustrator for rapidly designing schematics for scientific figures.
* [R script](https://gemini-series.netlify.app/code/Gemini_Workshop_20230425.R) - This script served as the basis for the coding portion of the workshop and contains great example code for Mark's beautiful ggplot graphics (including stats!).  You can use this code as a starting point for your own 'plug-and-play' ggplots.
* [csv file 1.0](https://gemini-series.netlify.app/code/Gemini.1.0.csv), [csv file 1.1](https://gemini-series.netlify.app/code/Gemini.1.1.csv), [csv file 2.0](https://gemini-series.netlify.app/code/Gemini.2.0.csv), [csv file 2.1](https://gemini-series.netlify.app/code/Gemini.2.1.csv) - all the data inputs used in the R script above.
