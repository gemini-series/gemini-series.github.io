The workshop will take place in the [Holman Reading Room](https://www.library.upenn.edu/holman) in the Biomedical library, and is free to UPenn graduate students, postdocs, faculty, and staff.

## Overview

The first part of the day will be devoted to learning about tidyverse and other methods for preparing data for plotting, as well as ggplot basics. After lunch, we will dive into more sophisticated options for plotting data, including interactive figures. Prerequisites for this course are basic familiarity with R and working installations of R, Rstudio and the tidyverse.
