## Registration

**REGISTRATION IS CLOSED** - the workshop is currently full.

The workshop is free to UPenn graduate students, postdocs, faculty, and staff.  Registration is required and seating is limited.

## Overview

Omiq allows researchers to complete their entire workflow in one software, going from raw data to statistical significance, using their own expertise and familiar tools seamlessly blended with dozens of cutting-edge computational methods and visualizations.

## About your instructor

This workshop will be taught by [Geoff Kraker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/geoff-kraker-6018b830). Geoff is a Senior Application Scientist at OMIQ with over 13 years of experience in cytometry spanning from academic flow cores to instrument manufacturers and several cloud based analysis platforms. He's a persistent advocate for data quality and is passionate about educating people in the field on approachable strategies for high dimensional cytometry analysis.

## Workshop details

All workshop attendees should visit [app.omiq.ai](app.omiq.a) and create an account by clicking on "Sign Up", and then entering an academic email address and a password. From there, you'll be asked to validate your email and then be able to log in to your trial account. The trial period runs for 3 weeks by default, but you can always reach out to the OMIQ folks to request an extension if you need more time to try out OMIQ with your data.

## What do you need to do?

Not much really!  Just sign-up for the free OMIQ account as indicated above, and be sure to bring your laptop and charger to the workshop.

## Workshop resources

Throughout the workshop you'll be using a dataset kindly provided by [Sokratis Apostolidis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=omj4tIQAAAAJ) that comes from [this 2021 Nature Medicine paper](www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01507-2) describing the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine response in individuals with multiple sclerosis receiving treatment with anti-CD20 to deplete B-cells (ocrelizumab or rituximab).  Don't stress about downloading the data, we'll have it ready to go in OMIQ and will share it with you once you've set up your OMIQ account.
