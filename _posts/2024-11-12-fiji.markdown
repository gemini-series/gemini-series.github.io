## Registration

**[Register using this form](forms.gle/q6M6xWY8hZj8n3YD8)!**.

The workshop will take place in the [Holman Reading Room](https://www.library.upenn.edu/holman) in the Biomedical library, and is free to UPenn graduate students, postdocs, faculty, and staff.

## Overview

Fiji is the 'batteries included' version of the venerable ImageJ software.  It bundles together many popular and useful ImageJ plugins for image analysis into one installation, and automatically manages their dependencies and updating. Fiji is easy to use and install - in one-click, Fiji installs all of its plugins, features an automatic updater, and offers comprehensive documentation.

## Getting set-up

To participate in the workshop, please plan to bring your laptop with charging cord, and **[download and install Fiji sofrware](https://fiji.sc/#download)**.

## Agenda

The morning will focus on learning the essentials with Fiji, and the afternoon will delve into more advanced functionality via plugins.
