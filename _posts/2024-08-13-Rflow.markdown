## Registration

**[Register using this form](https://forms.gle/txR2xq7gvGbGjmCD9)!**.  The workshop is free to UPenn graduate students, postdocs, faculty, and staff, but registration is required and seating is limited.

The workshop will take place in the [Holman Reading Room](https://www.library.upenn.edu/holman) in the Biomedical library, and is free to UPenn graduate students, postdocs, faculty, and staff.

## Overview

In this workshop, you'll learn to use the R programming language and the Bioconductor suite of software tools to carry out sophisticated analysis of flow data.  You'll learn how to more rigorously set gates, and automate the process of applying a gating strategy across even very large flow cytometric datasets.

## About your instructors

This workshop will be taught by Matei Ionita, PhD, Senior Data Analyst at I3H
