## Registration

**[Register using this form](https://forms.gle/ysSGNCCXYTC9VWgW6)!**  If you already completed this form for one of the other flow cytometry workshops in the GEMINI Series, then you're good to go!

The workshop is free to UPenn graduate students, postdocs, faculty, and staff.  Registration is required and seating is limited.

## Overview

FlowJo is an integrated environment for viewing and analyzing flow cytometric data.  In addition to gating and statistics, FlowJo has specialized analysis platforms for assays involving DNA/Cell Cycle, Kinetics, and Proliferation, among others. FlowJo’s sophisticated tools allow for generation of statistics, graphs, tables, web pages, and even movies. FlowJo integrates remote data hosting services (LIMS) and supports “cloud” deployment for excellent scaling of performance in a demanding.
