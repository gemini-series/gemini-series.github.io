The workshop will take place in the [Holman Reading Room](https://www.library.upenn.edu/holman) in the Biomedical library, and is free to UPenn graduate students, postdocs, faculty, and staff.

## Overview

FlowJo is an integrated environment for viewing and analyzing flow cytometric data.  In addition to gating and statistics, FlowJo has specialized analysis platforms for assays involving DNA/Cell Cycle, Kinetics, and Proliferation, among others. FlowJo’s sophisticated tools allow for generation of statistics, graphs, tables, web pages, and even movies. FlowJo integrates remote data hosting services (LIMS) and supports “cloud” deployment for excellent scaling of performance in a demanding.

## Agenda

The morning will focus on basic/introductory topics in FlowJo, and the afternoon will delve into more advanced functionality via plugins.
